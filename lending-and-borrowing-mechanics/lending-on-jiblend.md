# Lending on Jiblend

**How it Works:** Lenders deposit their cryptocurrency into Jiblend's liquidity pools. These pools act as collective funds from which borrowers can take loans. The interest rates are determined algorithmically, based on the supply and demand dynamics of each pool.

**Benefits for Lenders:** By contributing to the liquidity pools, lenders earn passive income in the form of interest payments. The interest rates are competitive and often higher than traditional banking returns, offering a lucrative opportunity for cryptocurrency holders.
