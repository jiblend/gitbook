# Borrowing on Jiblend

**How it Works:** Borrowers can obtain loans by providing collateral in a different cryptocurrency. This collateral ensures the security of the loan and determines the borrowing limit. The process is quick, with no need for credit checks, providing immediate access to funds.

**Collateralization and Liquidation:** To maintain the health of the system, loans are over-collateralized, and the platform continuously monitors the collateral-to-loan ratio. If the value of the collateral falls below a certain threshold, it is subject to liquidation to protect the lenders' assets.
