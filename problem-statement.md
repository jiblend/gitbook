# Problem Statement

Traditional finance is plagued by centralization, exclusivity, and inefficiency. Banks and intermediaries control lending, limiting access based on geography, financial status, and stringent criteria. This centralization of power hinders financial inclusion, raises costs, and fosters inequity.

Moreover, centralized systems lack transparency and security, leaving users vulnerable to fraud and manipulation. These challenges underscore the need for a decentralized lending solution that provides fair, open, and secure access to financial services for all.
